#### 1. Three main cloud computing models: IaaS,SaaS,PaaS  

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

- Software as a Service (SaaS)  - is the simplest form of cloud computing. There is no third-party development or resource for the user, rather SaaS applications offer powerful tools right from your web browser that, in most cases, give users the ability to collaborate with others cheaply and from any location.( google docs, gmail ) 

- Platforms as a service -  remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.
