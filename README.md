##### 1. Three main cloud computing models: IaaS,SaaS,PaaS  
  * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

  * Software as a Service (SaaS)  - is the simplest form of cloud computing. There is no third-party development or resource for the user, rather SaaS applications offer powerful tools right from your web browser that, in most cases, give users the ability to collaborate with others cheaply and from any location.( google docs, gmail ) 

  * Platforms as a service -  remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

##### 2. Cloud Computing Deployment Models
  * Cloud  
  * Hybrid  
  * On-premises  
 
##### 3. Deployment strategies https://thenewstack.io/deployment-strategies/ 

  * Recreate: Version A is terminated then version B is rolled out. 
  * Ramped (also known as rolling-update or incremental): Version B is slowly rolled out and replacing version A.
  * Blue/Green: Version B is released alongside version A, then the traffic is switched to version B.
  * Canary: Version B is released to a subset of users, then proceed to a full rollout.
  * A/B testing: Version B is released to a subset of users under specific condition.
  * Shadow: Version B receives real-world traffic alongside version A and doesn’t impact the response.


##### 4. Containerization vs virtualization ( Containers vs virtual machines )  https://blog.netapp.com/blogs/containers-vs-vms/
  * Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.

#### Agile/Scrum/Kanban https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/kanban-vs-scrum

##### 1. Agile
 * Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails. Today, agile is hardly a competitive advantage. No one has the luxury to develop a product for years or even months in a black box. This means it’s more important than ever to get it right.

##### 2. Kanban – Incremental Improvements
 * Kanban is all about continuous development and delivery, tackling a small number of tasks fluidly and concurrently. Kanban teams use a visual planning tool—the kanban board—that displays each project (user story) on a card and moves cards through columns that represent progressive stages of completion. If your team has a continuous stream of work requests, kanban may be right for you.
  ###### Release Methodology    
> In kanban, updates are released whenever they are ready, without a regular schedule or predetermined due dates.       
> In theory, kanban does not prescribe a fixed time to deliver a task. If the task gets completed earlier (or later), it can be released as needed without having to wait for a preset release milestone, as in the case of scrum.    
##### 3. Scrum  
  * Scrum also splits out complex tasks into user stories and visualizes them on a workflow. Scrum teams commit to ship working software at the end of set intervals, called sprints. If you need to ship value to customers on a regular basis, scrum is the way.  
   ###### Scrum Roles:  
> The Product Owner owns and manages the product backlog, understands business requirements, and prioritizes the work to be done by the development team.     
> The Scrum Master manages the scrum board and workflow, and helps the team stay grounded in the scrum framework.   
> The development team completes the work and demonstrates collective accountability.    

##### 4. Kanban vs Scrum 
  * Looking at both agile software development methodologies it should be more clear what to introduce when: If your organization is really stuck and needs a fundamental shift towards a more efficient process, Scrum seems to be more appropiate. If you already have working processes, which you want to improve over time without shaking up the whole system, Kanban should be your tool of choice.
  
##### 5. Agility 
 * Agility is something different all together. Agility is a clean, un-opinionated agile board that progressively adds more structure when you need it. If you can’t decide between scrum and kanban, go with an agility project. 
 
##### 6. ITSM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management
 * It is how you manage the information systems that deliver value to your customers.ITSM could include activities like planning and managing changes so they don’t cause disruption to the business, fixing things when they go wrong

##### 7. ITIL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL
 * set of detailed practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are not organization-specific or technology-specific, but can be applied by an organization for establishing integration with the organization's strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvement.ITIL is divided into a series of five core volumes, each covering a different ITSM lifecycle stage. These stages are:   
> Service Strategy   
> Service Design    
> Service Transition   
> Service Operation   
> Continual Service Improvement    


##### 8. Top Leadership Skills  https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-leadership-skills-2063782   
 * Communication - you need to be able to clearly and succinctly explain to your employees everything from organizational goals to specific tasks.
 * Motivation - need to inspire their workers to go the extra mile for their organizations.   
 * Delegating - identify the skills of each of your employees, and assign duties to each employee based on his or her skill set.    
 * Positivity   
 * Feedback ( Following up, coaching , Mentoring ...) 
 * Responsibility - A leader is responsible for both the successes and failures of his or her team. Therefore, you need to be willing to accept blame when something does not go correctly. ( Acknowledging mistakes, Project planning, Resolving problems)
